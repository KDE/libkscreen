KDE Screen Management is designed to be cross-platform from the begining, we are not aiming to
support Windows or Mac (they already have their screen management) but instead we must be sure
that we will be able to support the different Linux technologies that are present nowdays or the
ones that will appear in the future (X, Wayland, NVidia...).

The low level bits are un-abstractable, each technology export different kind of information for
example while XRandR give us stuff like "CRTC" Nvidia will only give us some high level info via
a binary executable called nvidia-sttings.

But everything is not lost, we can still create an abstraction the only thing we have to do is to
find something in common between all possible technologies out there, and we call such thing the
Screen Configuration.

No matter which underneath technology your setup is using, it will always support things like:

· Resolutions
· Rotations
· Cloned screens
· Extended Desktop (screens side by side)
· Custom modes...

So, instead of abstracting how graphics work we are going to have object(s) representing how your
screens are setup or are going to be setup.

This objects will travel through our architecture until they reach the code where they will be
translated into per-platform instructions, for example in case of XRandR the sytem will use
libxrandr while with NVidia we will use nvidia-settings.

The architecture should look as follow:
