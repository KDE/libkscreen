TODO

- WaylandScreen takes aggregate size of outputs for now (should ask compositor in the future?)
- create Modes from wl_output callback
- properly from wl_output callback
- create Edid from output-internal information
- try to keep wl_output* out of the API (except for WaylandOutput, perhaps)
- verify and fix m_outputMap
- handle callback's Done signal? how to trigger?
- update Output object
- update Screen object
