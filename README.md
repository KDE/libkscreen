libkscreen is the screen management library for KDE Plasma Workspaces. Its primary consumer is the KDE screen management application KScreen.

libkscreen is part of [Plasma releases][plasma-releases].

## End user
Since this is a development library end users should instead look for support directly for the apps using this library. Please contact the support channels of your Linux distribution first. In case you find a bug in KScreen or if the bug is traced back to libkscreen, you can report it at the KDE [bug tracker][bug-tracker] (first look for duplicates).
