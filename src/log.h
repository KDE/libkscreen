 * we need to debug the concert of kscreen components from different processes.
 *
 * KScreen::Log manages access to kscreen's log file.
 *
 * The following environment variables are considered:
 * - disable logging by setting
 * KSCREEN_LOGGING=false
 * - set the log file to a custom path, the default is in ~/.local/share/kscreen/kscreen.log
 *
 * Please do not translate messages written to the logs, it's developer information and should be
 * english, independent from the user's locale preferences.
 *
 * @code
 *
 * Log::instance()->setContext("resume");
 * Log::log("Applying detected output configuration.");
